    <h1>A LIST OF LISTS</h1>
    <p>
        Lists of the best, the worst, the most popular, and the funniest are all over the Web. 
        Here are some of our favorites.
    </p>

    <h2>Most Wanted</h2>
    <p>
        Mugs from the <i>FBI's list of 10 most wanted fugitives</i> are always available here. 
        Two years ago, comic-strip detective Dick Tracy joined the hunt and published profiles 
        from the list, including one of Osama bin Laden: "Thin, walks with a cane," it said.

    <h2>The Lycos 50</h2>
    <p>
        Who is hot and who is not in online searches? When we checked, Osama bin Laden and 
        <i>Martha Stewart</i> were on the decline, while Christmas and Harry Potter were ascending 
        on the list of most popular search terms at the Lycos service.

    <h2>List Universe</h2>
    <p>
        E-mail lists are Internet communities that share e-mail messages on any subject imaginable - 
        and some that arenâ€™t. List Universe is for anyone trying to set up a list, or to keep one going. 
        It gives tips on promoting a list, selling advertising for e-zines, and writing for an online audience.
